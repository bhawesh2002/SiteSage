# SiteSage — Automated SEO Performance Analyzer

SiteSage is a production-grade full-stack web platform that analyzes website URLs for SEO and performance quality.  
It crawls a given website, extracts key on-page SEO signals, evaluates performance metrics, and generates structured SEO reports enriched with AI-powered insights and optimization recommendations.

This project was built as part of a Full Stack Developer technical assignment for **Madeline & Co.**, with a strong focus on clean architecture, reliability, and pragmatic AI integration.

- **Frontend** communicates with the backend via REST APIs.
- **Backend** performs crawling, analysis, AI summarization, and persistence.
- **Database** uses PostgreSQL with Alembic migrations.
- **AI layer** is orchestrated using Letta (open-source client).
- **Deployments** are handled via Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend).

## 🧠 Design Decisions

- **Idempotent audits**: Submitting the same URL returns the existing audit instead of re-running analysis.
- **URL normalization** ensures consistent uniqueness across submissions.
- **AI output is treated as untrusted input** and defensively rendered in the UI.
- **Lightweight performance metrics** are used to avoid heavy external dependencies.
